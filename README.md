## ✅ Steps Followed

### 1. Created Multiple Passwords
Generated 5 passwords with different levels of complexity:

| Password Example  | Features Included                             |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| abhishek123       | Lowercase + numbers (Weak)                    |
| Abhishek@123      | Uppercase + lowercase + numbers + symbol      |
| Abhi@2025!        | Mix of characters + current year              |
| aB#98xL!pQ        | Random, high complexity                       |
| password          | Common word (Very weak)                       |

### 2. Tested Password Strength

| Password     | PasswordMeter Score | Security.org Crack Time | Feedback                           |
|--------------|---------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|
| abhishek123  | 34% (Weak)          | Instantly crackable      | Lacks complexity                   |
| Abhishek@123 | 86% (Strong)        | ~5 years                 | Good use of mixed characters       |
| Abhi@2025!   | 92% (Strong)        | ~25 years                | Strong structure + current year    |
| aB#98xL!pQ   | 100% (Very Strong)  | ~200+ years              | Ideal secure password              |
| password     | 10% (Very Weak)     | Instantly crackable      | Very common and weak               |

### 3. Key Takeaways: What Makes a Strong Password?

- ✅ At least 10–12 characters long  
- ✅ Includes uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols  
- ✅ Avoids common patterns or dictionary words  
- ❌ Never reuse passwords across different accounts  
- ✅ Use a password manager for safety and convenience  
- ✅ Turn on Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) where possible

## 🛡️ Password Attack Types

| Attack Type         | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Brute Force         | Tries every possible combination                                            |
| Dictionary Attack   | Uses lists of common words and phrases                                     |
| Credential Stuffing | Reuses stolen passwords from previous breaches                             |
| Phishing            | Tricks users into revealing their passwords                                |

## 🔒 Password Complexity vs. Security

Stronger passwords take exponentially more time to crack.  
Example:

- "pass123" → **cracked instantly**  
- "aB#98xL!pQ" → **may take 200+ years**  

Password complexity is one of the **most critical layers** of personal cybersecurity.
